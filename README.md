# Warehouse Problem - Algorithm Inspired by Nature

This project was completed as part of the "Algorithm Inspired by Nature" lecture in the Master's program at the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering (FIEK). For more information, please visit [FIEK](https://fiek.uni-pr.edu/). The project was undertaken by students Artan Thaqi and ValÃ«za Grainca.

## Project Description

The project involves the implementation of an Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm to solve a warehouse distribution problem. The problem involves determining the optimal allocation of goods from warehouses to stores, considering the capacity of the warehouses, the fixed cost of opening a warehouse, the supply cost from a warehouse to a store, and the incompatibility between certain pairs of stores.

## Algorithm Execution Details

The algorithm execution involves the following steps:

### Initialization
The program reads the problem data from a file. The data includes the number of warehouses and stores, the capacity and fixed cost of each warehouse, the demand of each store, the supply cost from each warehouse to each store, and the incompatible pairs of stores.

### Initial Solution Generation
The program generates an initial solution to the problem. The initial solution is generated by assigning goods to stores from the warehouses in the order of the supply cost.

### Iterated Local Search
The program performs an iterated local search on the initial solution. The local search involves tweaking the current solution by reassigning goods from one warehouse to another. The perturbation involves randomly selecting a warehouse and reassigning its goods to other warehouses. The process is repeated for a specified duration.

### Solution Evaluation
The program evaluates the quality of the current solution by calculating the total cost, which includes the fixed cost of opening the warehouses and the supply cost from the warehouses to the stores.

### Result Output
The program outputs the best solution found and its total cost. The solution is also saved to a text file.

## Detailed Code Breakdown

The code is divided into several methods, each performing a specific task in the algorithm:

- **Main:** This is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter the file name of the problem data, the duration for the iterated local search, and the possible intervals for the perturbation. It then reads the problem data from the file, generates the initial solution, performs the iterated local search, evaluates the solution, and outputs the result.
- **Tweak, TweakWarehouse, TweakStore:** These methods are used to tweak the current solution during the local search. They reassign goods from one warehouse to another, considering the capacity of the warehouses and the incompatibility between the stores.
- **Perturb, PerturbWarehouse:** These methods are used to perturb the current solution. They randomly select a warehouse and reassign its goods to other warehouses.
- **intialSol:** This method generates the initial solution. It assigns goods to stores from the warehouses in the order of the supply cost.
- **EvaluateSolution:** This method evaluates the quality of the current solution. It calculates the total cost, which includes the fixed cost of opening the warehouses and the supply cost from the warehouses to the stores.

## Results

The results of the algorithm execution are presented in tables. The tables include the details of the best solution found and its total cost. The results are also saved to a text file in the "Solutions" folder.

## Usage

To run the program, you need to have .NET Framework installed on your computer. You can run the program by executing the `Program.cs` file. The program will prompt you to enter the file name of the problem data, the duration for the iterated local search, and the possible intervals for the perturbation.
